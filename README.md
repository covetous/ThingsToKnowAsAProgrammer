# Things To Know As A Programmer #
A collection of links to and thoughts about being a good programmer. I make no claim to this being the ultimate guide. It is merely my own thoughts on the subject and others thoughts that I agree with to some or the full extent.

## README files ##
Readme files are an essential explenation of your software and most projects will have one. At least if they are public. Please do no be afraid to use them in private repos as well. Include anything that is needed to get started with the project and explaining the perticular aspects of the project. Why have you made designdecissions and such. Tailor the readme to the target. If you have a library focus on how to use the library. If it's an internal repo with multiple developers explain how to continue developing the project and how to test and run it.
Most README files are written in Markdown (.md). This is a nice way to make it more readable.

Included in the repo is the file markdown_cheatsheet.md copied from https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md .
